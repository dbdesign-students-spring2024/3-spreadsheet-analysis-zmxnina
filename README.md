### Data Set Problems & Corresponding Scrubbing Tasks
To prepare the original data set for import into a spreadsheet, the following problems were addressed through data scrubbing tasks done in Python.

1. Filtering Data Based on Year: 

    The original data set includes records spanning from 1995 to 2022. However, in order to concentrate on more recent trends, particularly those surrounding the period of the pandemic, the program filters the records to include only those from 2018 onwards.

2. Reduction of Fields: 

    The original data set contained an overwhelming number of 31 fields, making analysis rather cumbersome. Thus, the program streamlines the data set by including only a subset of relevant fields.

3. Time Interval Aggregation: 

    The original data set contained a granular breakdown of assault incidents, detailing them in two-hour time increments (e.g. TIME_0001_0200_CNT, TIME_0201_0400_CNT, etc.). This excess specificity could potentially obfuscate broader trends and patterns. Thus, the program aggregates the original intervals into four broader six-hour intervals (TIME_0001_0600_CNT, TIME_0601_1200_CNT, TIME_1201_1800_CNT, TIME_1801_0000_CNT) by summing up the counts for each six-hour block.

4. Consistency Check Between Different Types of Counts: 

    There are inconsistencies in the original data set between the total number of assaults per incident summed by time intervals (i.e. TIME_0001_0200_CNT, TIME_0201_0400_CNT, etc.) and by asault types (i.e. FIREARM_INJURY_CNT, FIREARM_NO_INJURY_CNT, etc.). For example, on row 282856 in the original datset:
    | DATA_YEAR | PUB_AGENCY_NAME | PUB_AGENCY_UNIT | STATE_ABBR | DIVISION_NAME | REGION_NAME | AGENCY_TYPE_NAME | POPULATION_GROUP_DESC        | COUNTY_NAME  | TIME_0001_0200_CNT | TIME_0201_0400_CNT | TIME_0401_0600_CNT | TIME_0601_0800_CNT | TIME_0801_1000_CNT | TIME_1001_1200_CNT | TIME_1201_1400_CNT | TIME_1401_1600_CNT | TIME_1601_1800_CNT | TIME_1801_2000_CNT | TIME_2001_2200_CNT | TIME_2201_0000_CNT | FIREARM_INJURY_CNT | FIREARM_NO_INJURY_CNT | KNIFE_INJURY_CNT | KNIFE_NO_INJURY_CNT | HANDS_FISTS_FEET_INJURY_CNT | HANDS_FISTS_FEET_NO_INJURY_CNT | OTHER_INJURY_CNT | OTHER_NO_INJURY_CNT | LEOKA_FELONY_KILLED | LEOKA_ACCIDENT_KILLED |
    |-----------|-----------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|-------------|------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|

    The total number of assault in this incident is 5 when summed by time intervals and 24 when summed by assault types. To maintain data accuracy and reliability, the program includes only those records where these two totals are equal.

5. Handling Missing or Irrelevant Data: 

    The original data included missing or irrelevant entries, where the total count is zero. For example, on row 282864 in the original data set:

    | DATA_YEAR | PUB_AGENCY_NAME | PUB_AGENCY_UNIT | STATE_ABBR | DIVISION_NAME     | REGION_NAME | AGENCY_TYPE_NAME | POPULATION_GROUP_DESC            | COUNTY_NAME | TIME_0001_0200_CNT | TIME_0201_0400_CNT | TIME_0401_0600_CNT | TIME_0601_0800_CNT | TIME_0801_1000_CNT | TIME_1001_1200_CNT | TIME_1201_1400_CNT | TIME_1401_1600_CNT | TIME_1601_1800_CNT | TIME_1801_2000_CNT | TIME_2001_2200_CNT | TIME_2201_0000_CNT | FIREARM_INJURY_CNT | FIREARM_NO_INJURY_CNT | KNIFE_INJURY_CNT | KNIFE_NO_INJURY_CNT | HANDS_FISTS_FEET_INJURY_CNT | HANDS_FISTS_FEET_NO_INJURY_CNT | OTHER_INJURY_CNT | OTHER_NO_INJURY_CNT | LEOKA_FELONY_KILLED | LEOKA_ACCIDENT_KILLED |

    This record exhibit zero values across all relevant fields pertaining to the number of assaults. Such records do not provide meaningful insights for our analysis and thus are omitted during the data scrubbing process.

 ## Analysis
 ### Aggregate Statistics
 1. Total number of LEOKA incidents from 2018 to 2022: 21378

    We observe that the complete count of reported LEOKA incidents over the five-year period is 21,378. This provides a macro-level view of the frequency of these incidents, which isn't readily discernible when examining individual records.

2. Average number of officers assaulted per incident from 2018 to 2022: 11.6110

    This statistic reflects the typical scale of an incident in terms of the number of officers assaulted. We observe that, on average, incidents tend to involve a significant number of 11 officers. This may imply that LEOKA incidents tend to occur in more complex scenarios where numerous law enforcement officers are engaged (e.g. protests, raids, etc.).

3. Maximum number of officers involved but not injured by a knife in one incident from 2018 to 2022: 38

    We observe that the maximum number of officers involved in a knife-related incident without sustaining injuries is 38, reflecting a parricularly volatile scenario that required a significant law enforcement presence. The large number may indicate an effective management of the situation. However, to fully assess the efficacy of the response and the risk posed by the incident, it would be necessary to compare this figure to the number of officers who were injured by a knife in the same situation.

4. Average number of officers assaulted per incident in the night (12:01 AM to 6:00 AM) from 2018-2022: 2.5591

    We observe that, on average, incidents at night tend to involve around 2 officers. This could lead to discussions about the inherent risks of night patrols or responses, the need for additional support during nighttime hours, or the potential for increased criminal activity at night.

### Aggregate Statistics with Conditions
1. Total number of officers killed in California in 2022: 4

    This statstic represents the total number of officers who lost their lives in the line of duty, either due to felonious acts or by accident, within the state of California in 2022. It provides a stark numeric value that underscores the potential risks faced by California law enforcement officers.

2. Average number of officers injured by hands, fists, feet per incident in cities with a population from 100,000 to 249,999 in 2021: 12.0645

    This statistic reveals that, within moderately populated cities of 100,000 to 249,999 residents, incidents in which officers are physically assaulted without weapons occur with some regularity and involve a notable number of 12 affected officers on average.
    
3. Maximum number of officers assaulted in one incident in New York state in 2020: 18

    This statistic represents the most significant LEOKA incident reported in New York state for the year 2020. It points to a particularly acute situation that involved 18 law enforcement officers, which could reflect a large-scale operation or a major public disturbance in the state.

4. Difference between the average number of officers assaulted per incident in the morning (6:01 AM - 12:00 PM) and in the evening (6:01 PM - 12:00 AM) in 2019: -2.7830

    This statistic reflects a comparative analysis between two distinct time periods of the day. We observe that, on average, 2 more officers are assaulted per incident in the evening hours than in the morning hours. This disparity suggests that incidents occurring in the evening are, on average, more likely to involve a greater number of officers.

The pivot table provides a platform for comparative analysis across various states. Notably, states such as California, Florida, and Texas stand out with their high assault counts, potentially implicating severe risks faced by law enforcement officers within these regions. It is imperative, however, to contextualize these findings within the demographic landscape. The significant total assault frequencies in California, with 23,402 incidents, Florida with 19,133, and Texas with 22,778, can be partially attributed to their status as the most populous states in the country. A higher population density typically translates to larger numbers of law enforcement personnels and interactions, which naturally leads to a higher absolute number of recorded assaults. 

Further, we observe that the aggregate data from all states combined reveals a notable decline in the total number of assaults during 2020 and 2021, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. This reduction aligns with a period marked by widespread lockdowns and social distancing measures, potentially leading to fewer interactions between law enforcement officers and the public. Additionally, the pandemic may have inflicted changes in crime rates, patterns, and police activities, which could account for the observed decrease in LEOKA incidents.

## Extra Credit: Large & Complex Data
I believe this assignment deserves extra credit from option 2 as it tackles an extremely large and complex raw data set with 324,157 records each catalogued with 31 fields, far transcending the provided definition of a large data set with thousands of rows. Thank you!
